# hosts-jp

Categorized hosts files for DNS based content blocking. This is meant to be used as a regional component of a more comprehensive hosts list, such as [Steven Black's hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

Hosts are categorized by:

- adware
- malware
- fakenews
- gambling
- porn
- social
- board

In the case where a site is an ambiguous mix between blog / content platform and social network (Ameba, Pixiv, etc...), the site is not listed.
